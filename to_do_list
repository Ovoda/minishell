FIX
ls | bonjour -> status return 


string ending with ">" or "|" or ";"

check env variables ($>, SGV)
recode ";" errors (the actual code is discuting lol)

check pwd with arguments (pwd ok)
make sure process status are good
^D with line
make sure ^C, ^\ work fine
fix tabs


__SECONDARY STUFF__
Delete BUFFER_SIZE on compilation
cat instead of /bin/cat for errors
